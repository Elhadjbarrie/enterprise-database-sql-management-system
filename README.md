# Enterprise Database Management System (SQL)

This academic project was developed collaboratively as part of a university assignment.
The objective of the project is to design and implement a robust relational
database system for enterprise operations. The database supports core business
processes such as employee management, project tracking, financial operations,
and data governance, with a strong emphasis on data integrity and consistency.

## University chat module

The `sql/SQLQuery11.sql` script extends the dataset with a student-facing chat
module that lets you organize conversations by student permanent code, first
name, last name, and department. It introduces department, student,
conversation, participant, and message tables, plus a search view and demo
data to get started quickly.
